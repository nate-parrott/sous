# A sous chef for your dock

His name is Tommy Tortellini and he lives in your dock. He's a little chef who can help you with all sorts of things. He can run Applescript to perform system actions, and he can pull in data from the web. He's a little bit like Siri, but he's a chef, and he lives in your dock.

You need to give him an OpenAI API key. You can get one [here](https://platform.openai.com/).
